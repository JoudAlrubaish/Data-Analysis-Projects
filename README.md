# Data-Analysis-Projects 

This repository showcases my work in **data exploration, visualization, and storytelling** using real-world datasets.  
The goal is to extract insights that inform decisions and highlight the power of data-driven thinking.  

## What You'll Find Here  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Cleaning, preprocessing, and summarizing datasets.  
- **Dashboards**: Interactive reports built in Power BI and Excel.  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identifying trends, correlations, and patterns.  
- **Case Studies**: Healthcare data, financial analytics, and open datasets.  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- SQL queries for data wrangling  
- Power BI & Excel dashboards  
- Communicating insights clearly and visually  

## Goal  
To bridge technical analysis with real-world storytelling, making data not only accurate but also actionable.
